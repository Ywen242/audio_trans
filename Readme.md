<Overview>
This project is developed for personal use, specifically to assist in accounting research. It focuses on analyzing the audio from earnings calls, particularly the responses of speakers during the Q&A sessions. The program is designed to identify, clip, and store relevant audio segments locally for further analysis.

<Related files>
audio: This directory contains the original earnings call audio files.

clipped_audio: This directory is where the clipped audio segments are stored after processing.

name_change.py: A Python script used to rename files in the audio directory into a uniform format.

upload.bat: A batch script for uploading files from the audio directory to a GitHub cloud storage repository.

audio_clip.py: The main Python script used for clipping the audio files. It processes the original earnings call audio, identifies the relevant segments, and clips them accordingly.

<Usage>
To use this tool, follow these steps:
1. Place the original earnings call audio files in the audio directory.
2. Run the name_change.py script to standardize the file names.
3. Run the upload.bat script to upload the processed files to the designated GitHub cloud storage so that the AsssemblyAI's API can download and process the audio.
4. Execute the audio_clip.py script to process the audio files. This will identify the relevant segments from the Q&A sessions and clip them into separate audio files, which will be saved in the clipped_audio directory.
